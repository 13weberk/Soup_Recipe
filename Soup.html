I like my lentil soup this way, without too many herbs or any chicken broth. Recipes that call for those things are nice enough, but I like the brightness and mild acidity the soup has this way. I think it complements the earthy flavor of the lentils and the mirepoix.

<p>Important reminders and tips:
- Wash your lentils. And I did find a stone once, so keep an eye out.

- I like to use red wine vinegar in this, but I have used apple cider vinegar in a pinch, and I'm sure other vinegars could be fun. I mean, not white distilled of course. That stuff is for cleaning the coffee pot and disinfecting the cutting board, IMHO.

- Salt is key. I just made a batch of this and had to adjust the salt a couple times. The flavor is subtle so you need to use enough to bring it out, but if you use to much you'll overpower it. When I eat alone, I add salt in the bowl until it tastes about right. I think Kosher salt may do a noticeably better job here. Thanks to Carlo who got me paying more attention to my salt after a conversation we had awhile ago. </p>
